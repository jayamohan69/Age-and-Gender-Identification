# Age-and-Gender-identification-MachineLearning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict age and gender from facial images using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and can be trained on datasets like UTKFace or IMDB-WIKI.

Features
Age Prediction: Predicts the approximate age group of an individual.
Gender Prediction: Classifies the gender based on facial features.
Deep Learning: Uses CNNs for high accuracy in predictions.
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Age-and-Gender-identification-MachineLearning.git
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download and place the dataset in the data/ directory.
Usage
Run the training script to train the model:

python train.py
To make predictions on new images:

python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
Dataset
The project supports popular datasets like UTKFace and IMDB-WIKI, which contain images labeled with age and gender information.
